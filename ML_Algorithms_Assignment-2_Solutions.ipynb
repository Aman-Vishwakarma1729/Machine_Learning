    "R-squared (R²) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in a linear regression model. It is also known as the coefficient of determination.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared ranges from 0 to 1, with a value of 0 indicating that none of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables, and a value of 1 indicating that all of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is calculated by dividing the explained variance by the total variance. The explained variance is the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the mean of the dependent variable, while the total variance is the sum of the squared differences between the actual values and the mean of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the formula for R-squared is:\n",
    "\n",
    "R² = 1 - (SSres / SStot)\n",

    "where SSres is the sum of the squared residuals (the difference between the actual and predicted values), and SStot is the total sum of squares (the difference between each actual value and the mean of the dependent variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a higher value of R-squared indicates a better fit of the model to the data, as it suggests that a greater proportion of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables. However, it should be noted that a high R-squared value does not necessarily mean that the model is a good fit or that the independent variables are causally related to the dependent variable. It is important to also consider other metrics such as the p-values and coefficients of the independent variables and assess the model's assumptions and limitations."

    "Adjusted R-squared is a modification of the regular R-squared that takes into account the number of independent variables used in a linear regression model. It is calculated as a normalized version of the R-squared value that adjusts for the degrees of freedom of the model.\n",

    "The regular R-squared measures the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables.

    "The adjusted R-squared, on the other hand, penalizes the inclusion of unnecessary independent variables by adjusting the R-squared value based on the number of independent variables used in the model. Specifically, it subtracts a penalty term from the regular R-squared that increases as the number of independent variables increases.\n",

It is a better measure of how well the independent variables are actually contributing to the model and how well the model is likely to generalize to new data.
