For example, a study may seek to understand the relationship between hours spent studying and exam scores. In this case, the exam score would be the dependent variable, and the hours spent studying would be the independent variable. Simple linear regression seeks to model this relationship by fitting a straight line to the data.\n",

For example, a study may seek to understand the relationship between a person's income and their age, education level, and years of work experience. In this case, income would be the dependent variable, and age, education level, and years of work experience would be the independent variables. Multiple linear regression seeks to model this relationship by fitting a linear equation to the data that includes multiple independent variables"

    "Linear regression is a statistical technique that makes certain assumptions about the data. These assumptions are important because they help ensure that the results of the analysis are accurate and meaningful. Here are the main assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable(s) is linear. This means that the change in the dependent variable for a unit change in the independent variable is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Independence: The observations in the dataset are independent of each other. This means that the value of the dependent variable for one observation does not depend on the value of the dependent variable for another observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors (the difference between the actual and predicted values) is constant for all values of the independent variable. This means that the spread of the residuals is the same across the entire range of the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normality: The errors follow a normal distribution. This means that the residuals should be normally distributed around zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "* No multicollinearity: There is no perfect correlation between independent variables. This means that the independent variables should be uncorrelated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, there are several methods that can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Residual plots: The residuals (the difference between the actual and predicted values) should be randomly scattered around zero. A plot of the residuals against the predicted values can help identify any patterns or non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normality plots: A histogram or QQ-plot of the residuals can be used to check whether the errors follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cook's distance: Cook's distance is a measure of how much the model predictions would change if a particular observation were removed. High Cook's distance values indicate that a particular observation has a large influence on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variance inflation factor (VIF): VIF measures the correlation between independent variables in a multiple regression model. A high VIF indicates that there is multicollinearity in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Durbin-Watson test: This test can be used to check whether there is autocorrelation in the residuals (i.e., whether the residuals are correlated with each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these assumptions are violated, the results of the analysis may be biased or unreliable. In such cases, the data may need to be transformed or alternative models may need to be considered."

A positive slope indicates a positive relationship between the two variables, while a negative slope indicates a negative relationship.\n",

    "Gradient descent is a widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning that is used to minimize the cost function of a model by iteratively adjusting the model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical supervised learning problem, the goal is to find the model parameters that minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual values in the training dataset. This difference is typically measured by a cost function, such as mean squared error or cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent works by iteratively updating the model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the cost function. The steepest descent is found by calculating the gradient of the cost function with respect to the model parameters. The gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the greatest increase of the cost function, so by taking the opposite direction of the gradient, we can move towards the minimum of the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic steps of gradient descent are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the model parameters to some arbitrary values.\n",
    "2. Compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to the model parameters.\n",
    "3. Update the model parameters by taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient, scaled by a learning rate parameter.\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the cost function converges to a minimum.\n",
    "5. The learning rate parameter determines the size of the step taken in each iteration. If the learning rate is too small, the optimization process may be slow, while if the learning rate is too large, the algorithm may fail to converge or even diverge.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several variants of gradient descent that are used in practice, such as batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent, which differ in how the gradient is calculated and how the model parameters are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is a powerful optimization algorithm that is widely used in machine learning to train models on large datasets. It is an iterative process that can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets or complex models, but it is highly effective at finding the optimal model parameters that minimize the cost function"
